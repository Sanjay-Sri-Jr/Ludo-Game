Turning your project into a **working Ludo game** involves several steps. Here’s a roadmap and some advice to get you started:

---

### 1. **Game State & Logic**
- **Represent the board:** Use a JavaScript array or object to represent the board and each player's pieces (position, home, finished, etc.).
- **Track turns:** Keep track of whose turn it is.
- **Dice roll:** You already have dice rolling working.
- **Piece movement:** When a player rolls, allow them to move a piece according to Ludo rules.

---

### 2. **Moving Pieces**
- **Clickable pieces:** Make pieces clickable only when it’s that player’s turn and a valid move is possible.
- **Update position:** When a piece is moved, update its position in your data structure and move its DOM element to the correct cell.
- **Send home:** If a piece lands on an opponent, send that piece home.

---

### 3. **Win Condition**
- **Check for win:** When a player gets all four pieces to the center, declare them the winner.

---

### 4. **UI Feedback**
- **Highlight active player.**
- **Show possible moves.**
- **Disable dice/pieces when not allowed.**

## Example: Basic Game State Structure

````javascript
// Example structure
const players = [
  { color: 'red', pieces: [0, 0, 0, 0] }, // 0 = home, 1-52 = board, 100 = finished
  { color: 'green', pieces: [0, 0, 0, 0] },
  { color: 'yellow', pieces: [0, 0, 0, 0] },
  { color: 'blue', pieces: [0, 0, 0, 0] }
];
let currentPlayer = 0;
let diceValue = 0;
````

---

## Example: Moving a Piece

````javascript
function movePiece(playerIndex, pieceIndex, steps) {
  // Update the player's piece position
  players[playerIndex].pieces[pieceIndex] += steps;
  // Update the UI: move the piece DOM element to the new cell
}
````

## 5. **How to Start**
- **Step 1:** Build a data structure for the board and pieces.
- **Step 2:** On dice roll, highlight movable pieces.
- **Step 3:** On piece click, move it and update the board.
- **Step 4:** Implement Ludo rules (entering board on 6, capturing, safe zones, etc.).
- **Step 5:** Add win detection.
